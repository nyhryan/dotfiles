# stamp shown in the history command output.
# You can set one of the optional three formats:

# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.

# users are encouraged to define aliases within the ZSH_CUSTOM folder.
